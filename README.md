## Installation

**Warning:** This is an experimental feature. Proceed at your own discretion. 

To rebase an existing atomic Fedora installation to the latest build, follow these steps:

1. **Rebase to the Unsigned Image**  
   This step installs the necessary signing keys and policies:
   ```bash
   rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/rustyrin/ros:latest
   ```

2. **Reboot the System**  
   Complete the rebase by rebooting:
   ```bash
   systemctl reboot
   ```

3. **Rebase to the Signed Image**  
   After rebooting, rebase to the signed image:
   ```bash
   rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/rustyrin/ros:latest
   ```
